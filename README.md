# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The project was developed as part of my internship task at Internpe. The goal of this project was to implement a regression model that can accurately estimate the market price of a car using machine learning techniques.

# Features:
Data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
XGBoost Regressor used for model building.
Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.
Performance evaluation with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.
Visualizations comparing Actual vs Predicted car prices.
# Libraries Used:
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model building, preprocessing, and evaluation.
XGBoost: Gradient boosting model for regression tasks.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
# Model Evaluation:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
R² Score: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.
The model's performance is displayed after running the script, including a plot of actual vs predicted prices.

# Project Objectives:
Develop a machine learning model for predicting car prices.
Apply regression techniques in a real-world scenario.
Complete the internship task at Internpe and gain hands-on experience in machine learning.
